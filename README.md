Hey David,

Hope you are having a wonderful day!

In terms of AI Usage, I generally used the built in GPT-5 based AI Assistant for all the styling.
I created the base structure (Components) and then asked it to create a navigation based on that.

Afterward I inserted the images and the text. 
It did struggle quite a bit with the images, but after multiple attempts it worked.
It took some minor corrections to how it wanted to combine html and css, for whatever reason it always wanted to insert the images directly via css...

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. (Contact information is included in the website... ^^)

Take care,
Ben
